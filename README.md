# react-cli

[Scaffholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding) tool for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

react-cli is a command line interface which brings smooth developer experience (DX) for React devs. react-cli provides a better way to generate react projects with [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/99xt/react-boilerplate). With this tool it's possible to continue generating boilerplate code with heavy customizations once a project is initiated.
